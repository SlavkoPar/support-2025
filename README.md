## This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Try It
[Support Knowledge Database](https://slavkopar.github.io/support-2025/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`


## Dokumentacija (bice bolja, ovo je samo za jutrasnji miting) 

You are software company and You have your software product.\
Your QA people, repeatedly interupt your developers with the same questions.\
Developers need to read documentation or open Visual Studio, investigate code, returning the answer.\
It is very boring an unefficient.

With our  **Support Knowledge** Chrome Extension you can easily build and maintain your Knowledge database.\
Our extension can easily be integrated to all kind of browseres.\
Extension treats email Subject as the Question, and with single click, stores it to the database.\
Extension also eables easy return of the Answer over the email.\
Answer can be chosen from the Answers assigned to that Question .

Of course, you can use one of existing trackers, educate people, \
or even use call center with voice recognition and **AI**, and so on ...\
But it is expensive and overkill.

## Building Chat Bot using **Support Knowledge**

We could develop **Chat Bot** after enabling some structure of the **Support Knowledge Database**, To make logic of conversation, for example using notion of Answers related to some Answer and workflows with logic.\

## Export **Support Knowledge Database** to other JSON formates

The idea is exporting of the **Support Knowledge Database** to the formats, expected from the following sites:\
[Azure Cosmos-DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction)\
or\
[Tawk](https://www.tawk.to/software/knowledge-base)\
