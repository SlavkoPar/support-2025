You are software company and You have publisheh your software product.\
Your QA people, repeatidly interupt your developers with the same questions.\
Developers need to read documentation or open Visual Studio, investigate code, returning the answer.\
It is very boring an unefficient.

With our  **Support Knowledge** Chrome Extension you can easily build and maintain your Knonwledge database.\
Our extension can easily be integrated to all kind of browseres.\ 
Extension treats email Subject as the Question, and with single click, stores it to the database.\
Extension also enables easy return of Answer asigned to the Question, over the email.

Of course, you can use one of existing trackers, educate people, \
or even use call center with voice recognition and **AI**, and so on ...\
But it is expensive and overkill.
